As we all know, the best way to learn new things is by teaching others 
and this blog is my way to learn new things.

I will mainly write on this blog about software development in terms of my 
main programming languages, i.e `Python` and `JavaScript`.

Also, I'm going to write here about the programming languages and technologies I learn.
At this moment my main interest is `Rust`, `Erlang/Elixir` and `ML`/`DL`/`NLP`.

So, that's it.

You can read more about me [here](https://isaak.dev/about).

P.S I'm not a native English speaker, so I hope my readers will treat my 
grammar mistakes with patience and understanding.
