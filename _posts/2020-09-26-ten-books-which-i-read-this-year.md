No doubt this was a pretty strange year with a bunch of free time. Everyone tried to kill the time as they can — watching TV shows and movies, playing video games, reading books, etc. I’ve read a lot of interesting books in quarantine, and in this article, I’m going to tell you about these books!

This post is not advertising and the only reason I'm leaving the links is to make it easy to find books for ones who want to buy them.

**Authors**: [David M. Beazley](https://twitter.com/dabeaz), [Brian K. Jones](http://twitter.com/bkjones)

I’m not a newbie in Python, but I found this book very useful anyway. It helped me to refresh my knowledge. I was happy to see how such a cool developer as David solves some problems the same way I would do. This book if for ones for already know Python as well, but wants to learn new elegant hacks and recipes of cooking idiomatic Python.

This book is one of the coolest books about high load applications and databases. From this book, I’ve learned how works some of the most important mechanisms of nowadays highly available database systems (replication, partition, sharding, constancy, clustering, etc.)

I'm highly recommending these books for developers who want to know more about databases in complex and distributed systems.

Once I’ve learned about Erlang and after that, I fall in love with functional programming. I like learning new things and what can be newer than Lisp-like language when you always had deal with Algol-like languages?

I’ve learned a lot about Clojure and functional programming from this great book. I would recommend it to everyone interested in learning new concepts. Thankfully to this book now I understand how the meta-programming mechanism (macroses, quoting/unquoting) exactly works in Clojure and unexpectedly in Elixir.

## 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts.
This book is just a compilation of great notes about software development in general written by different experienced developers from different kind of fields.

I love Erlang and that’s true. I’ve never used it in production direactly, but I’m still in love with this language. I’ve read 2 books about Erlang before this one («Erlang Programming» by Francesco Cesarini and Simon Thompson and «Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!» by Fred Hebert), but I’ve still learned new things about Erlang in general and OTP namely (there are few really interesting chapters about supervisors and applications).

Well, the author of this book is a Robert Martin aka «Uncle Bob» and that’s the only thing you need to know about this book to buy it right now.

## The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers
This book is pretty similar to «97 Things Every Programmer Should Know» but this one is written by Robert Martin based on his own damn rich experience of software development.

I’m not gonna lie, I didn’t finished this book yet, but I have to nclude it to this article, because I’ve learned a lot about the Phoenix Framework from this book. I’ve read about plugs, endpoints, request/response lifecycle, ecto, channels and so on.

## The Little Ecto Cookbook
Well, since I learn Phoenix it makes sense for me to read about Ecto too. I’ve learned this book to know how to work with databases trough the stateless language, where you can’t use habitual ORM.

I've learned some good concepts from this book too. I can recommend this book for developers who wants level up their knowledge of Django's best practices.
