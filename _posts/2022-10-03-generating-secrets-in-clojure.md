Generating secrets is a very important part of any security-sensitive application. In this article, I'm going to tell you about a low-level library that helps to generate secrets in Clojure.

If you're familiar with Python, you might have heard of [secrets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) module from Python's standard library. 

Well, the [secrets.clj](https://github.com/lk-geimfari/secrets.clj) is just like Python's secrets, but for Clojure â€” it's a library designed to generate cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets. 

## Installation

Add `secrets.clj` to your `project.clj` file:

```clojure
[likid_geimfari/secrets "1.1.1"]
````

then run `lein deps` to install it. 

That's it, you're ready to go:

```clojure
(ns example.core
  (:require [secrets.core]
            [secrets.tools]
            [secrets.constants]))
```

## Usage

Typical use cases are:

- Generating random numbers
- Creating passwords, SMS-codes and OTP
- Generating random tokens
- Generating password recovery URLs and session keys

##### secrets.core/randbelow(n)

This function generates a secure random integer in the range `[0, n)`, where `n` is the exclusive upper bound.

Example: 

```clojure
user=> (secrets.core/randbelow 9999)
34
```

##### secrets.core/choice(seq)

This function returns a random element from a non-empty sequence or throws an exception if the sequence is empty.

```clojure
user=> (secrets.core/choice ["bob" "alice" "eve"])
"eve"
```

##### secrets.core/choices(seq)

Just like `secrets.core/choice`, but this function returns a list of random elements picked from the sequence:

```clojure
(secrets.core/choices ["bob" "alice" "eve"] 2)
("eve" "alice")
```

##### secrets.core/token-hex(nbytes)

Generates a secure random string in hexadecimal format. The string has `nbytes` random bytes, and each byte is converted to two hex digits. 
If n-bytes are not supplied, a reasonable default gets used, which is 32.

```clojure
user=> (secrets.core/token-hex(64))
"3a3e8e6636000dd3b7d39aa4316935f27c2f013d768f0c00f309efb453f34dbc673060db2cd8af288494892848"
```

##### secrets.core/token-urlsafe(nbytes)

Generates a secure random string in URL-safe format.

```clojure
(defn generate-password-recovery-url [n]
  (str "https://mydomain.com/reset=" (secrets.core/token-urlsafe n)))

(generate-password-recovery-url 64)
"TItm04q8by00MRMcNBt7I3Yx-wSxyUa79isRLNyQJCd8K75RnqUahwcWA_rURBt1clknJiRGrubapGaUrEUnSw"
```

##### secrets.core/token-bytes(nbytes)

Generates a secure random string in bytes format.

```clojure
(secrets.core/token-urlsafe(16))
#object["[B" 0x3b2454e9 "[B@3b2454e9"]
```

## How many bytes should tokens use?

To be secure against brute-force attacks, tokens need to have sufficient randomness.
The number of random bits needed for a token depends on the application, but 256 bits 
is considered to be cryptographically strong.

Personally, I would recommend using 64 bytes (`512 bits`).
