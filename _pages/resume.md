Hi, my name is Isaak.

I have been developing software for over 5 years, of which 4+ years have been developing web 
applications and web APIs in Python (Django, DRF). I write reliable, maintainable code following 
the best practices in the language I am dealing with.

I am able to independently organize my time and therefore I do not need supervisors behind my back.

I am an active contributor in Open Source also I maintain my own projects in various languages 
(Python, JS, Erlang, Clojure, Rust, and so on, just check out [my profile] on GitHub).

Just for the record, I note that I also know Russian, so you can write to me in Russian.
