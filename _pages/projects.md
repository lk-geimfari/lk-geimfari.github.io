[`Mimesis`]({{ site.projects.mimesis }}) is a high-performance fake data generator for Python, which
provides data for a variety of purposes in a variety of languages. The
fake data could be used to populate a testing database, create fake API
endpoints, create JSON and XML files of arbitrary structure, anonymize
data taken from production and etc.

The key features are:

- **Performance**: The [fastest] data generator available for Python.
- **Extensibility**: You can create your own data providers and use them with Mimesis.
- **Generic data provider**: The [simplified] access to all the providers from a single object.
- **Multilingual**: Supports data for [a lot of languages].
- **Data variety**: Supports [a lot of data providers] for a variety of purposes.
- **Schema-based generators**: Provides an easy mechanism to generate data by the schema of any complexity.
- **Country-specific data providers**: Provides data specific only for [some countries].
