## Mimesis

[![mimesis_logo_img]][Mimesis]

[Mimesis] is a high-performance fake data generator for Python, which
provides data for a variety of purposes in a variety of languages. The
fake data could be used to populate a testing database, create fake API
endpoints, create JSON and XML files of arbitrary structure, anonymize
data taken from production and etc.

The key features are:

-   **Performance**: The [fastest] data generator available for Python.
-   **Extensibility**: You can create your own data providers and use them with Mimesis.
-   **Generic data provider**: The [simplified] access to all the providers from a single object.
-   **Multilingual**: Supports data for [a lot of languages].
-   **Data variety**: Supports [a lot of data providers] for a variety of purposes.
-   **Schema-based generators**: Provides an easy mechanism to generate data by the schema of any complexity.
-   **Country-specific data providers**: Provides data specific only for [some countries].

## Expynent

[expynent] is a tiny library that provides common regular expression patterns. This can be useful if you don't want to 
write regular expression manually. Also you can use this library as [fixture](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html) for testing framework like a [py.test](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

## pytest-mimesis

[pytest-mimesis] is a pytest plugin that provides pytest fixtures for [Mimesis] providers. 
This allows you to quickly and easily use randomized, dummy data as part of your test suite.
