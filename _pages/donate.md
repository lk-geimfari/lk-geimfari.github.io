If you're enjoying [things]({{ "/projects/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) I do and want to support me then you can send me some crypto.

If youâ€™re not enjoying the things I do, you can write me an angry letter, angry tweet
record a diss rap or even stab me in the dark alley (I'm kidding, I would be thankful if you would not do that).
