Hi! I'm Isaak Uchakaev (Russian: Исаак Учакаев).

Currently, I'm working as a Backend Engineer at [roskomsvoboda].

Like any other programmer and passionate professional, I love learning new things 
and technologies, and sometimes, I write my thoughts about such things in this blog.

Generally, I work with `Python` and `JavaScript`, but I’m also familiar with `Erlang`, 
`Elixir`, `Clojure` and `Rust`, so all my posts mainly will be related to those topics.

#### Reach me

My PGP key: [{{ site.pgp.fingerprint }}]({{ site.pgp.key }})

The most preferable way to contact me is emailing me, so there is my
email: <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>

This probably will not work, but please, don’t contact me if you’re a
Nigerian prince who wants to share 1 million dollars with me.

Contact me, if you want to:

* Offer me a good job (you can find my [resume here])
* Offer me a partnership
* Ask something related to my activity (GitHub/Blog)
* Report about a typo in the post or something
