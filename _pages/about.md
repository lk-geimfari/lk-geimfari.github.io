My name is Isaak Uchakaev.

I work as a Backend Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/roskomsvoboda"><b>@roskomsvoboda</b></a>

Like any other programmer and professional, I love learning new things
and technologies and sometimes, I write my thoughts about such things in
this blog.

## Stack

Generally, I work with `Python` and `JavaScript`, but I’m also similar
with `Erlang`, `Elixir` and `Rust`.

I use MacBook Pro 13” and if you’re interested, you can reproduce my
setup using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lk-geimfari/macbook">this project</a>.

## Contact me

The most preferable way to contact me is emailing me, so there is my
email: <a href="mailto:likid.geimfari@gmail.com"><b>likid.geimfari@gmail.com</b></a>

This probably will not work, but please, don’t contact me if you’re a
Nigerian prince who wants to share 1 million dollars with me.

Contact me, if you want to:

1.  Offer me a good job
2.  Ask something related to my activity on GitHub
3.  Report about a typo in the post or something
