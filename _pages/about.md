Hey! I'm Isaak ðŸ‘‹

I have a strong enthusiasm for acquiring new knowledge and mastering emerging technologies. I often take the time 
to articulate my thoughts about these subjects in my personal blog.  In my day-to-day, I primarily engage with 
`Python`, `Go` and `JavaScript`. 

However, I also possess a solid grasp of languages such as `Erlang` and `Clojure`. As a result, 
the majority of my blog posts will revolve around these topics.

#### Reach me

You can best reach me by dropping an email at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> â€” it's my
preferred method of contact.

My PGP key: [{{ site.pgp.fingerprint }}]({{ site.pgp.key }})

You can reach out if:

* You're interested in a potential partnership
* You have an enticing job opportunity
* You'd like to inquire about my GitHub or Blog activities
* You spot a typo or have feedback on a post
* You'd like to request a specific post on a particular topic


Slim chance, but if you're a Nigerian prince with a million to spare, hang onto it! You've got more use for it than I do, pal.
