Hey! I'm Isaak ðŸ‘‹

At the moment, I work as a Backend Engineer at [roskomsvoboda], where I'm deeply involved in my role.

I have a strong enthusiasm for acquiring new knowledge and mastering emerging technologies. I often take the time 
to articulate my thoughts about these subjects in my personal blog.

In my day-to-day, I primarily engage with `Python` and `JavaScript`. However, I also possess a 
solid grasp of languages such as `Erlang`, `Elixir` and `Clojure`. As a result, the majority 
of my blog posts will revolve around these topics.

#### Reach me

My PGP key: [{{ site.pgp.fingerprint }}]({{ site.pgp.key }})

The most preferable way to contact me is emailing me, so there is my
email: <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>

This probably will not work, but please, donâ€™t contact me if youâ€™re a Nigerian prince who 
wants to share 1 million dollars with me. Keep it, because you need it more than I do, mf.

Contact me, if you want to:

* Offer me a partnership
* Offer me a dream job (you can find my [resume here])
* Ask something related to my activity (GitHub/Blog)
* Report about a typo in the post or something
* Ask me to write a post about something
