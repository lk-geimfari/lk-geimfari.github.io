Hi! I'm Isaak Uchakaev (Russian: Исаак Учакаев).

Currently, I'm working as a Backend Engineer at [roskomsvoboda].

Like any other programmer and professional, I love learning new things
and technologies and sometimes, I write my thoughts about such things in
this blog.

Generally, I work with `Python` and `JavaScript`, but I’m also familiar with `Erlang`, 
`Elixir`, `Clojure` and `Rust`, so all my posts mainly will be related to those topics.

#### Contact me

The most preferable way to contact me is emailing me, so there is my
email: <a href="mailto:likid.geimfari@gmail.com">likid.geimfari@gmail.com</a>

This probably will not work, but please, don’t contact me if you’re a
Nigerian prince who wants to share 1 million dollars with me.

You can also contact me in Telegram: [@likid_geimfari]

Contact me, if you want to:

* Offer me a good job ([you can find my resume here])
* Offer me a partnership
* Ask something related to my activity (GitHub/Blog)
* Report about a typo in the post or something
