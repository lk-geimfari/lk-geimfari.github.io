My name is Isaak Uchakaev.

I work as a Backend Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/roskomsvoboda"><b>roskomsvoboda</b></a>.

Like any other programmer and professional, I love learning new things
and technologies and sometimes, I write my thoughts about such things in
this blog.

## Stack

Generally, I work with <code class="code-tag">Python</code> and <code class="code-tag">JS</code>, 
but I’m also similar with <code class="code-tag">Erlang/OTP</code>, <code class="code-tag">Elixir</code> 
and <code class="code-tag">Rust</code>.

I use MacBook Pro 13” and if you’re interested, you can reproduce my
setup using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lk-geimfari/macbook">this project</a>.

## Contact me

The most preferable way to contact me is emailing me, so there is my
email: <a href="mailto:likid.geimfari@gmail.com"><b>likid.geimfari@gmail.com</b></a>

This probably will not work, but please, don’t contact me if you’re a
Nigerian prince who wants to share 1 million dollars with me.

Contact me, if you want to:

1.  Offer me a good job
2.  Ask something related to my activity on GitHub
3.  Report about a typo in the post or something
